# Veep

Keep your Youtube videos playback positions in sync across all of your devices and browser restarts.

Veep is a WebExtension, currently written for the Chrome browser. It allows you to save the playback position of the Youtube videos you watchÂ : if you close the player tab and reopen the video later (possibly on another computer), the player starts the video where you left it.

In order to let the playback positions synchronize across all of your devices, you need to be logged into Chrome with the same account and have the sync enabled in the browser settings on every devices.
